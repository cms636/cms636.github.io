For my visualization update, I tried many different graphs and charts on the Many Eyes website. The one I found most interesting is below, a simple word cloud of all the plays in the 1770s. I like it because what most surprised me was the small number of very popular plays. I would have suspected that among the huge number of plays available, there would have been a larger set of popular plays. Instead, we can clearly see four winners. I also wish I had been able to improve their collisions detection. The word overlap bothers me a lot.
