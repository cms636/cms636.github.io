For the Burdick reading on Enhanced Critical Curation, we see themes that are emerging still today: an abundance of information, a need and desire to (critically) sort through it and present it, a continued need to tell stories and communicate the human narrative. I think about the role of the curator as educator, especially in framing museums as learning spaces: "existence of vast quantities of data, articfacts, or products is in no guarantee of impact or quality" (Burdick, 2012). I think in the present day, with all the information at learners' access, and more and more becoming available everyday, I wonder how curators mirror / are educators in the sense of helping to guide people to critically understanding and making sense of all of that information. Do curators have more control over what exactly they present (vs. teachers in a traditional formal classroom) and how does that interact with the learning experience?
