I one hundred percent agree with the sentiment and opinion that is discussed in Nicholas Carr’s article. Personally, I feel like I fall under the category of “those affected”. The internet is a great thing, to an extent. The internet opens the opportunity to learn more about something that you have no knowledge about. People are turning to the internet to widen their field of knowledge, using online learning organizations like MIT OCW to explore unknown fields. But many people, including me, rely on the internet to solve problems or for basic knowledge. This has it’s downfall. Now there is a generation that is growing up with the internet in hand and that may severely affect them. They may not learn the problem solving skills necessary to properly evaluate and solve. In general, the internet has been both a crutch and a helper, and it will be interesting to see how it really affects us as the true generation of the net grows up.
