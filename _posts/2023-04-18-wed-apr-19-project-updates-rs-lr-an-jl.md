Here is the link to our MuseConnect [Update Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vNCht3AUVDkG-e3kiqb4bgKYlVc0QSpdyx4LqxQ4UiQ/edit?usp=sharing). 

- Initial designs are linked within the slide deck and also [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/ZVSrnm8R2P88IrQMtd8XWd/interactive-prototype-3?node-id=1-103&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2).
- From audience observation and user feedback we learned, amongst other things:
-- Half of all observed visitors interact and/or take photos within a gallery
--- Some kind of engagement is desired
-- The dynamically (dis)appearing responses and seeing the response move onto the wall is compelling and would get engagement
-- Looking for low-stakes, simple, quick ways to engage with an interaction piece
-- Prompting, scaffolding, agency for different ways to engage within the interaction piece (respond, react, comment) are important
-- A compelling, open-ended question is key to getting engagement
- Changes to the original idea are slight: we are focusing on short response -- one way to engage for one exhibit -- and keeping the original elements of being able to respond and react to others' responses. We are now utilizing projection technology to provide a better aesthetic and larger visual impact for visitors.
- Questions we continue to work on:
-- Is the “Share” button meaningful?
-- What can we do to maximize both the likelihood that people will engage and the quality (informational, interactional) of their experience?
--- How can we make sure the cognitive load isn’t too high so that people do actually engage with this?
--- What aesthetic approaches are enticing and inviting while not detracting?
