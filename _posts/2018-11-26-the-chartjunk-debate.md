The main argument of this paper was that adding irrelevant "junk" information to graphs is not at all that useless. The researchers argue that even though the data in some graphs may not be organized in the simplest and most efficient way, they help readers remember the main takeaways in the long term. This may be true for graphs designed for users that are not experts with the topic at hand, such as those described in the paper that appear on newspapers. These type of graphs may even need to be presented in such manner so that readers would actually be interested in reading them. Graphs that are used in the workplace on the other hand need not any of these embellishments, since they are meant to be read by people already familiar with the topic. This research however made too many assumptions by only studying cases by a very small group of people. To be able to show trends they need more people from different backgrounds as well.
