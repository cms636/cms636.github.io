title: API Exercise - Object Classifications
author: Sarah Edwards
---
I'm not super great with coding in javascript so it took me awhile to figure out how to make anything happen, but I ended up going with a pie chart of the different object classifications listed in the API. There are 59 distinct object classifications but for the sake of the pie chart I focused on the 6 largest categories and lumped the rest of them together since after that point they get fairly small compared to the rest of the pie chart. It's not much but I'm happy that it works.
