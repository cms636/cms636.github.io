As someone interested in experimental music, especially examples exploring the nature and limits of sound, I find sonification to be an amazing tool for new forms of artistic expression. My first exposure to sonification was in a piece by the contemporary electronic music genius Aphex Twin. In his song officially titled:

, but is often referred to as “[Equation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9xMuPWAZW8)”, Aphex Twin carries the mathematical as well as the visual to the sonic realm. Similarly Lucier’s _I am sitting in a room_, which is mentioned in the text, is a really original and mesmerizing conversion of physical space into audio. Both of these examples take things that seemingly don’t belong in the sonic realm, and express them in new ways. But does Aphex Twin’s sonic expression of an equation aim to convey a mathematics message to the listener? Would such an aim even be meaningful?

My opinion is no. I interpret both examples above as demonstrating the plasticity and aesthetic diversity of sound as a sensory stimulus. But aesthetic richness doesn’t necessarily mean usefulness, and this is a point that Sterne and Akiyama don’t seem to fully agree with.

While talking about the aesthetics of sonification, the authors discuss crossovers between art and science to represent scientific data in the form of sounds. They suggest that the aesthetics of data representation might unlock new aspects to the information that might otherwise be lost. This is an opinion that I can’t fully disagree with. But aesthetics is always secondary to ease of interpretation, and I think that sonic representations often lack this feature. This is even evident in the examples they list: both Atmospherics and Molecular Music are seen (even by their creators) as artworks, and not really useful representations of data.

The only area that I can see sonification utilized as a tool is the topic of accessibility for blind people. This is an area that I did not even consider before reading the text, and I fully support its utilization in this field. But even in this case, I find speech (which the authors don’t consider within the context of sonification) to be much more powerful as an auditory stimulus.
