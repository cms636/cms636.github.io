For the UI, the events could be made easier to click. Also, when you click on an event, if another event that seems to be clickable overlaps with the area of the screen containing the events info, then you cannot click it. It would be helpful to have dates next to each event on the event list so users do not need to click on many events to get a sense of time. The map could be divided on the locations of that time to get a sense of place when going through each event. An explanation of what the descriptors(complacent,focused,etc.) mean could also be added.
