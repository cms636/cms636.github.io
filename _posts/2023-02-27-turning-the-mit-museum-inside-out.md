title: Turning the MIT Museum Inside Out
author: 'Rachel Sawdy, Amy Ni, Jack Liufu'

**A description of the issue/problem that you are trying to address**
- Are MIT students who are currently visiting the MIT Museum getting/learning/leaving with the purpose of the museum: to “turn MIT inside out” and make MIT’s work more accessible and visible to the world?
- Potential addressing of this could be using AR to help embody an experience — development, production, etc. of a project — to enable the visitor to visualize being part of the process / being part of MIT.
- How about the visitors who are not affiliated with MIT? When they leave the museum do they gain a better understanding of what MIT is or embodies? 
- Driven and inspired by some of our readings and conversations around participatory engagement in museums–how can we utilize AR (or another digital technology) to realize MIT Museum’s purpose of making MIT’s work accessible and visible?
- Like other museums, MIT Museum might have a lot more artifacts currently not on display. Could we use AR or some digital catalog to make those more visible to those who wants to learn more?
- If AR is used purposefully to enhance the museum experience for MIT students, then they will learn more deeply about the chosen exhibit, so that MIT’s work displayed in the museum becomes more accessible and visible to its current students.
- AR can potentially make any interaction or participation less intimidating since everyone will have their own devices to work with(as opposed to the lascaux interactive exhibit discussed in class)

**The envisioned audience for your project**
- Current (and future) MIT students (or potentially outside visitors)

**Potential museum collaborators (currently MFA; Harvard Art Museums, MIT-Museum, and others are possible as well)**
- MIT Museum

**Technological/spatial/installation approach (if part of the project)**
- AR- Embodied experience
- Participation/engagement

**Skill sets needed for your project**
- AR coding
- Research / statistics
- Educational / pedagogical
