title: On AI and Museums - JL

On the Brock (2022) reading, a quote that stood out to me was: "external users feel more strongly that anything that allows expanded access to the collection has value". And from the Styx (2021) reading, I think the general sentiment expressed of paralleling AI to the Internet and that to be left behind (i.e. not integrating and using AI) would be like not using digital media or leveraging huge potential. These ideas come together in the conflict and tension that we've already been exploring in class: how do you keep up / utilize AI in a way that's meaningful and impactful (along the lines of expanding access (Brock, 2022)) while not falling behind (Styx, 2021)?

It's interesting to note that both these articles are from prior years, before ChatGPT and the seeming boom of AI and generative technologies; even the other two articles, one from Jan 2022 and one from March 2023, almost seem out of date; for myself at least, my Twitter feed and so much media that's around is harping on how new AI tools are being released every single day and don't fall behind and make sure you're maximizing your potential.
