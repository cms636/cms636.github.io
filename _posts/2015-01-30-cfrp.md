## The Comédie-Française Registers Project

The [Comédie-Française Registers Project](http://hyperstudio.mit.edu/projects/comedie-francaise-registers-project/) collects and makes available to scholars more than a century's worth of historical data from the archives of a royal theater in Paris. CFRP is led by Jeff Ravel of MIT's history department and has been a long-running project of [HyperStudio](http://hyperstudio.mit.edu). Right now, the contents of registers spanning from 1740 to 1793 are accessible through a [faceted browser](http://app.cfregisters.org/registers), which quickly filters and aggregates data across multiple categories and also links to scans of the original documents themselves.
