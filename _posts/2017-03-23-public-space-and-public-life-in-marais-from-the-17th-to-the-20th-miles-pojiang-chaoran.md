  Public Space and Public Life in Marais (From the 17th to the
  20th)-Miles-Pojiang-Chaoran
---
Le Marais is a historic district in Paris, France. From mid-13th century to the 17th century, the Marais was the French nobility's favorite place of residence. After the French Revolution, the district was no more the aristocratic district it once was during the 17th and 18th centuries. Because of this, the district became a popular and active commercial area, hosting one of Paris' main Jewish communities. And recently it’s become more of a gay neighborhood and a hip area for shopping, design, arts. Through looking at the public open space, such as the plazas and courts, and the historical sites, we would like to have a better understand of how the public space and the public life have transited through the time in Marais from the 17th century to the 20th century.

1 We create the collections in a chronological way and put the photos which reflect the the history, major event, function, form and activities in that period in each one.we are not only presenting the form of public space but also what people did inside it. These collections can give visitors the knowledge of how the urban space and the related urban activities transformed over time.
