__NOTE: I notice that Karleigh also went to the Museum of Science and discussed some topics (ex. demographic, types of technology). So, in order to avoid repeating information, I will discuss the interior/exterior of the museum, an unexpected behavior, one possible frustration with the museum, and provide more examples of technology.__

## Welcome and Interior/Exterior
Although the exterior of the building and the lobby (ticketing area + information booth) are quite typical, the museum distinguishes itself with a large T-Rex outside and a Rube Goldberg Machine inside.

## Unexpected Behavior
Interestingly, attendees tended to flock to displays which were mechanical, rather than purely digital. The novelty of the mechanical displays were the main attraction.

This screen in the food exhibit was abandoned for a long time.

I had to queue for several minutes before photographing the popular magnetic canvases.


## Possible Frustration
While the museum captivates attendees and encourages interaction (ex. footrace between children), many of the attendees, adults included, did not pay attention to the informational content.

The audio tour was rarely used, and the sheer number of displays caused attendees to avoid reading informational boards, and instead move on to play with the next exhibit.

Children ran along this in this sensor-filled racetrack, but few read the information.

Many exhibits have audio tours, but I only saw two attendees use them.

In the wind exhibit, childen would play with the interactive display and run off before listening/reading the science.

## Conclusion
The interior/exterior of the museum are typical, with a few distinguishing features. The exhibit halls themselves were highly unique and well decorated. The mechanical displays were very popular, but they were so widespread that attendees rarely read the science.

Many displays used a computer and a few buttons.
